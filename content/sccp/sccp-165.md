## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Enable shorting for sSOL on Optimism. 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

With the passing of [SIP-199](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-199/), sSOL will soon be live to trade on L2. This SCCP proposes to enable the shorting contracts for the sSOL on Optimism. 

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Traders using Synthetix via Kwenta on Optimism already have the ability to short sETH, sBTC and sLINK. It is important to ensure a consistent experience as new synths are added over time. 

Ecosystem projects like Lyra also require shorting as a key part of their mechanism.
